# Hash Cake
An Android app that creates MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes of given strings.

*This was created in the course of a couple hours for the [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/TheCraftKid/100-days-of-code)
challenge.*


## Usage
Simply type in a string, select a hashing function, and long-tap to copy 
your result. The field updates as you type in a string.
